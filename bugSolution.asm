To prevent memory access violations:

* **Bounds checking:** Always check array indexes and memory pointers before accessing memory to ensure they are within valid limits.
* **Proper initialization:** Initialize registers and pointers before use to prevent them from containing garbage values that could lead to invalid memory addresses.
* **Memory allocation:** Use appropriate memory allocation functions to allocate sufficient memory space and avoid buffer overflows.

To prevent stack overflow/underflow:

* **Termination condition:** Ensure that recursive functions always have a proper termination condition to prevent infinite recursion.
* **Stack size:** Allocate sufficient stack space when running applications that use a large amount of stack memory.
* **Stack pointer management:** Carefully manage stack pointer movements to avoid stack underflows.

The corrected code (bugSolution.asm) will include checks to avoid these errors.
