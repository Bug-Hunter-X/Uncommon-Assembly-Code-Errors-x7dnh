mov eax, [ebx+4*ecx] ;This line can cause an exception if EBX + 4*ECX is not a valid memory address. This is especially problematic if ECX is a large number or if EBX is not properly initialized. 

mov dword ptr [eax], 10 ;This line can cause an exception if EAX points to a memory location that the program is not allowed to write to. 

This is an example of memory access violation error. 

Another common error is stack overflow or underflow. If we are using recursive function without a termination condition or allocating too much memory on the stack, we may get a stack overflow exception. Likewise, if we try to access the stack below the current stack pointer, we may get a stack underflow exception.
